# Tranport-GUI

Vehicle Management GUI Application

This project was aimed to develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Java programming. The primary objective was to implement a Vehicle class, with subclasses for Auto rickshaws and Electric Scooters. Java, renowned for its cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Mac OS, and various UNIX versions), was the chosen programming language for this endeavor.

Key components used in this GUI model include JFrame, JPanel, JLabel, JTextField, and JButton. These elements were skillfully employed to facilitate the input and management of vehicle details, as well as the seamless execution of purchase, selling, and hiring functions.

This GitHub repository serves as a platform for sharing the project and its source code with the wider community. Feel free to explore, contribute, or use this project as a reference for your own Java GUI development endeavors.
